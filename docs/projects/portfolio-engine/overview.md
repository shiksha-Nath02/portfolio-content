# Overview

The Story-Driven Portfolio Engine is a content-first documentation platform.

Instead of showcasing static screenshots or bullet points, this system renders:

- Narrative sections from Markdown
- Interactive architecture from JSON
- API trees dynamically
- Database explorers
- Evolution timelines

The goal is to transform a portfolio into a technical documentary.
