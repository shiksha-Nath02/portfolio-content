# Challenges

## 1. No Backend Constraint
The system must function entirely without a backend server.

## 2. Content Separation
Narrative and system data needed clean separation (Markdown vs JSON).

## 3. Dynamic Rendering
Architecture diagrams must be rendered from structured JSON instead of static PNG files.

## 4. Multi-Project Scalability
The engine should scale to support multiple projects automatically.
